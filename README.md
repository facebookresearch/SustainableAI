Sustainable AMI

The past 50 years has seen a dramatic increase in the amount of computing capability per person, in particular, those enabled by AI. Despite the positive societal benefits, AI technologies can come with significant environmental implications. To scale AI sustainably, we need to make AI and computing more broadly efficient and flexible. Going beyond efficiency, we look into designing and optimizing AI models and computing infrastructures across the lifecycle. This repository provides resources from our research innovations and artifacts to talks and education materials to sustainably advance towards artificial general intelligence.
